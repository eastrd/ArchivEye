digrams such as TH, ED, etc. In the second-order approximation, digram structure is introduced. After a
letter is chosen, the next one is chosen in accordance with the frequencies with which the various letters
follow the first one. This requires a table of digram frequencies p;(j). In the third-order approximation,
trigram structure is introduced. Each letter is chosen with probabilities which depend on the preceding two
letters.

3. THE SERIES OF APPROXIMATIONS TO ENGLISH

To give a visual idea of how this series of processes approaches a language, typical sequences in the approx-
imations to English have been constructed and are given below. In all cases we have assumed a 27-symbol
“alphabet,” the 26 letters and a space.

1. Zero-order approximation (symbols independent and equiprobable).

2. First-order approximation (symbols independent but with frequencies of English text).

3. Second-order approximation (digram structure as in English).

4. Third-order approximation (trigram structure as in English).

5. First-order word approximation. Rather than continue with tetragram, ... , n-gram structure it is easier
and better to jump at this point to word units. Here words are chosen independently but with their
appropriate frequencies.

6. Second-order word approximation. The word transition probabilities are correct but no further struc-
ture is included.

THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH WRITER THAT THE CHAR-
ACTER OF THIS POINT IS THEREFORE ANOTHER METHOD FOR THE LETTERS THAT
THE TIME OF WHO EVER TOLD THE PROBLEM FOR AN UNEXPECTED.

The resemblance to ordinary English text increases quite noticeably at each of the above steps. Note that
these samples have reasonably good structure out to about twice the range that is taken into account in their
construction. Thus in (3) the statistical process insures reasonable text for two-letter sequences, but four-
letter sequences from the sample can usually be fitted into good sentences. In (6) sequences of four or more
words can easily be placed in sentences without unusual or strained constructions. The particular sequence
of ten words “attack on an English writer that the character of this” is not at all unreasonable. It appears then
that a sufficiently complex stochastic process will give a satisfactory representation of a discrete source.

The first two samples were constructed by the use of a book of random numbers in conjunction with
(for example 2) a table of letter frequencies. This method might have been continued for (3), (4) and (5),
since digram, trigram and word frequency tables are available, but a simpler equivalent method was used.
