Let a block of seven symbols be X1,X2,...,X7. Of these X3, X5, X6 and X7 are message symbols and
chosen arbitrarily by the source. The other three are redundant and calculated as follows:

X4 ischosentomake a@=X4+X%5+X%5+X7 even
X? ee ee ee ee B = X? + X3 + X + X7 ee
X| ee ee ee ee Y = X] + X3 + Xs + XT ee

When a block of seven is received a, 3 and ¥ are calculated and if even called zero, if odd called one. The
binary number a 3 y then gives the subscript of the X; that is incorrect (if 0 there was no error).
APPENDIX 1
THE GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS OF SYMBOLS WITH A FINITE STATE CONDITION

Let N;(L) be the number of blocks of symbols of length L ending in state i. Then we have

Nj(L) = VNi(L— bi)

where bij; bi, ..., bj; are the length of the symbols which may be chosen in state i and lead to state j. These

are linear difference equations and the behavior as L > co must be of the type
L
Nj; =AjW”.

For this to be possible the determinant

must vanish and this determines W, which is, of course, the largest real root of D = 0.
The quantity C is then given by

C=Lim

and we also note that the same growth properties result if we require that all blocks start in the same (arbi-
trarily chosen) state.

Let H (-. —,...,—] =A(n). From condition (3) we can decompose a choice from s” equally likely possi-
nn n

bilities into a series of m choices from s equally likely possibilities and obtain

A(s”) = mA(s).
