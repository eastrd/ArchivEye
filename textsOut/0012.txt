3. Suppose there are two events, x and y, in question with m possibilities for the first and n for the second.
Let p(i, j) be the probability of the joint occurrence of i for the first and j for the second. The entropy of the
joint event is

H(x,y) =—)' pli, j) log pi, /)

while
H(x) =—) pli, /)log Yi pli, /)
H(y) =—Y pli, /) log) pli, i)

It is easily shown that
H(x,y) < H(x) + H(y)
with equality only if the events are independent (i.e., p(i, /) = p(i)p(j)). The uncertainty of a joint event is
less than or equal to the sum of the individual uncertainties.
4. Any change toward equalization of the probabilities p;,p2,..., Pn increases H. Thus if py < p2 and
we increase p1, decreasing p2 an equal amount so that p; and p2 are more nearly equal, then H increases.
More generally, if we perform any “averaging” operation on the p; of the form

P=) aijpj
7

where )';4i; = aij = 1, and all aj; > 0, then H increases (except in the special case where this transfor-
mation amounts to no more than a permutation of the p ; with H of course remaining the same).

5. Suppose there are two chance events x and y as in 3, not necessarily independent. For any particular
value i that x can assume there is a conditional probability p;(j) that y has the value j. This is given by

pili) = P(i, j)

I —_ yt

LP)

We define the conditional entropy of y, H,(y) as the average of the entropy of y for each value of x, weighted
according to the probability of getting that particular x. That is

Ac(y) =~)’ pli, /) log pil) -

This quantity measures how uncertain we are of y on the average when we know x. Substituting the value of
pi(j) we obtain

Ax(y) = — pli, flog pli, f) + Y pli, /) log) pli. /)
= (x,y) — H(x)

or
H(x,y) = H(x) + Hx(y).

The uncertainty (or entropy) of the joint event x,y is the uncertainty of x plus the uncertainty of y when x is
known.
6. From 3 and 5 we have
A(x) + H(y) > H(x,y) = A(x) + Ax(y).

Hence
H(y) > H,(y).

The uncertainty of y is never increased by knowledge of x. It will be decreased unless x and y are independent
events, in which case it is not changed.
