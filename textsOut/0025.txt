As in the noiseless case a delay is generally required to approach the ideal encoding. It now has the
additional function of allowing a large sample of noise to affect the signal before any judgment is made
at the receiving point as to the original message. Increasing the sample size always sharpens the possible
statistical assertions.

The content of Theorem 11 and its proof can be formulated in a somewhat different way which exhibits
the connection with the noiseless case more clearly. Consider the possible signals of duration T and suppose
a subset of them is selected to be used. Let those in the subset all be used with equal probability, and suppose
the receiver is constructed to select, as the original signal, the most probable cause from the subset, when a
perturbed signal is received. We define N(T,q) to be the maximum number of signals we can choose for the
subset such that the probability of an incorrect interpretation is less than or equal to q.

In other words, no matter how we set out limits of reliability, we can distinguish reliably in time T

enough messages to correspond to about CT bits, when T is sufficiently large. Theorem 12 can be compared
with the definition of the capacity of a noiseless channel given in Section 1.

15. EXAMPLE OF A DISCRETE CHANNEL AND ITS CAPACITY

A simple example of a discrete channel is indicated in Fig. 11. There are three possible symbols. The first is
never affected by noise. The second and third each have probability p of coming through undisturbed, and
q of being changed into the other of the pair. We have (letting a = —[plogp + qlogq] and P and Q be the

H(x) = —PlogP —2QlogQ
Hy (x) = 2Qa.
We wish to choose P and Q in such a way as to maximize H (x) — H,(x), subject to the constraint P+ 20 = 1.

Hence we consider
U = —PlogP —2QlogQ —2Qa+ \(P+2Q)
