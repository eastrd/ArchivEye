Fig. 12—-Examples of discrete channels with the same transition probabilities for each input and for each output.

In Fig. 12a it would be
C = log4 — log2 = log?2.

This could be achieved by using only the Ist and 3d symbols. In Fig. 12b
C=log4—- 2 log3 - zlog6
= log4 — log3 — zlog2
= log 193 .
In Fig. 12c we have
C = log3 — 5 log2 — 4 log3 — 4 log6

= log Sahel
Suppose the symbols fall into several groups such that the noise never causes a symbol in one group to
be mistaken for a symbol in another group. Let the capacity for the nth group be C,, (in bits per second)

when we use only the symbols in this group. Then it is easily shown that, for best use of the entire set, the

total probability P,, of all symbols in the nth group should be
2on
P,= al Gr

Within a group the probability is distributed just as it would be if these were the only symbols being used.
The channel capacity is

C= logy 2%.
17. AN EXAMPLE OF EFFICIENT CODING

The following example, although somewhat unrealistic, is a case in which exact matching to a noisy channel
is possible. There are two channel symbols, 0 and 1, and the noise affects them in blocks of seven symbols.
A block of seven is either transmitted without error, or exactly one symbol of the seven is incorrect. These
eight possibilities are equally likely. We have

C = Max [H(y) — H,(y)]
= 7[7+ glog 3]
= 4 bits/symbol.

An efficient code, allowing complete correction of errors and transmitting at the rate C, is the following
(found by a method due to R. Hamming):
